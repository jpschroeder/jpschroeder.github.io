Hello World!

This is the first post for my new experimental blog, Tumbleweed Technology.  I named it this way because I assume that absolutely no-one is going to actually read it.  I plan to post here about various techie things that I come across day to day.  It could be random technology that I think is cool; It could problems that I encounter; It could just be things that I don't want to forget.

This blog is written in [markdown][markdown], using [sublime text][sublime], powered by [jekyll][jekyll], and running on top of [github pages][github_pages].  You can find the source [here][github_source].

If you are actually reading this (and are not, in fact, a tumbleweed), feel free to contact me at the email below.

Since this is my first post, I figured I would include a quick tip.  To enable spell checking in sublime only for markdown files, just open a markdown file, select ```Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific - User``` and enter the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "spell_check": true
}
{% endhighlight %}
